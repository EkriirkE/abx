# abx
Decode Android Binary XML files (ABX)

Either pipe data in, or pass a filename.  Output can be redirected to a new file.  Various formatting options in the main script.

`# python3 abx.py binary.xml > normal.xml`



I saw a few utilities that required whole packages or java but I want neither of those.  So I whipped this up and it worked for me needs.  Some ABX>XML codes are not handled as I did not encounter them so I could not verify any translation accuracy
